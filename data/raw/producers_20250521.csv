By the end of May 2001, due to lack of communication from the team responsible for the [url=https://vgmdb.net/album/115652]Blue Canary[/url] fan-disk, the ones responsible for [url=/v1499]Hooligan[/url] release and Front Wing, plus the high publishing costs and delay in some releases, Front Wing withdrew from the Green Green contract with Gungho and put the Green Green project up for order which was bought on May 2001 by Starlink. The representative of Front Wing released a statement around June 2001, claiming that the team responsible for Green Green were not involved with the company and were simply freelancers. After some time, Gungho created a substituary of Starlink known as GROOVER.

A year later, Front Wing wanted the project back entirely and sued Gungho and Starlink employees for copyright. This didn't work out and Front Wing lost the case.

After the release of Green Green: Kanenone Dynatic, employees of GROOVER and Gungho followed Bamboo to his next project Edelweiss that was being published on his independent VN brand OVERDRIVE in 2006. GROOVER's official website closed around March 31st, 2008. Regarding the independent VN brand [url=/p240]OVERDRIVE[/url], its operations were officially ended on April 30th, 2022.

Until Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gainax typically worked on stories created in-house, but the studio has increasingly developed anime adaptations of existing manga like Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou and Mahoromatic. Gainax could be said to produce two types of anime today: commercial works like Mahoromatic and He is My Master versus more experimental works that follow the company's traditions, such as FLCL and Diebuster. In addition to anime production, Gainax heavily merchandises its famous properties. For example, even though Evangelion ended in 1996, games, t-shirts, and various other memorabilia are still being produced.

Anime created by Gainax that have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award have been Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water in 1991, Neon Genesis Evangelion in 1995 and 1996, and The End of Evangelion in 1997.

Gainax has also produced a number of computer games, including a strip mahjong game featuring Evangelion characters, and its most famous games, the Princess Maker series, which was later adapted as Puchi Puri Yūshi.

 June 7, 2024, Gainax announced that it had filed for bankruptcy on May 29 and ceased operations, citing financial mismanagement decisions and substantial debt accumulation (which as of 2020 was over ¥380 million). The Gainax trademark was transferred to khara, Inc..

Chunsoft introduced the series with the ""Sound Novel"" brandname, which they trademarked. The ""Sound Novel"" name is just as popular as ""Visual Novel"" in Japan.

While ""Novel"" games are mostly associated with anime art in the west, Chunsoft's original Sound Novels did not use the art style for most part. Instead, they use various art styles, sometimes even using styles very rare in videogames. The first game, Otogirisou, used 2D pixel art (due to limitations of the ROM size), but later games like Kamaitachi no Yoru used photographs or 3DCG scenery combined with silhouettes, and few games such as Machi or 428 even went as far as to using a large number of filmed-on-location live stills using real actors.

Chunsoft games also feature experimentation in the structures of the narrative. Kamaitachi no Yoru had a standard branching plot; Otogirisou and Imabikisou had the narrative moving back and forth across a mesh of multiple subplots; and Machi and 428 had what they called a ""Multi Fragment"" narrative structure, which had multiple protagonists running in parallel, interlocked with each other."

Part of the producers, illustrators, and scenario writers of this project have since moved to [url=https://vndb.org/p130]GROOVER[/url], a subsidiary of [url=https://vndb.org/p326]Star Link[/url], claiming that they were freelancers not involved with Frontwing.

After the release of The Fruit of Grisaia, translated by [url=https://vndb.org/p162]Sekai Project[/url] in 2014, Frontwing ventured into the overseas market themselves when they established their own fully-fledged localization team in 2015. They officially debuted with The Leisure of Grisaia in 2016. 

On September 10, 2018, Frontwing Lab was established as a subsidiary for anime and game planning, with [url=/s6198]Yamakawa Ryuuichirou[/url] serving as representative director. In March 2019, Frontwing formed a business partnership with Bushiroad, and on April 1, 2021, Bushiroad acquired a majority of Yamakawa’s shares, making Frontwing Lab a consolidated subsidiary.

On September 30, 2024, Frontwing acquired all shares of Frontwing Lab held by Bushiroad, leading to Frontwing Lab’s exit from the Bushiroad group. It was also announced that Frontwing will now join the Good Smile Company group.

Each game generally features young, Japanese girls, who in way or another, find themselves either kidnapped or attacked by monsters, cyborgs, aliens or just men or women lacking in moral fibre. While some games have two or three different game paths available to the character, neither of these are particularly hard to obtain, and the games are considered more like animated slideshows than real bishoujo games.

The company went bankrupt around 2000, and the last game was released in 2003.

Their art of writing is improved by working primarily on indie visual novels (Assistant of detective Zbyšek, Princes of Fantasy). And they mostly learn about game design through jams or other small projects (Losing it, SSSCFATT).
Ondřej Sýkora as Syky (the robust one) is a brake in work process, strict director with sense for detail and pessimist. He keeps projects down to earth and supervises the composition and rules. While Emil Gašparec as Moti (the skinny one) is a dreamer, innovator and thinking constantly out of the box.

Nexon was founded in Seoul, South Korea in 1994 by Kim Jung Ju and Jake Song. In 2005, the company moved its headquarters from Seoul, South Korea to Tokyo, Japan.

Nexon maintains various offices around the world that engage in the publishing and/or development of Nexon's games. Each region's local consolidated subsidiaries are independently managed and are responsible for developing their own strategy for their products and services. The subsidiary that publishes a game does not necessarily indicate the region(s) that a game is available in. For example, some of Nexon Korea's games are published directly by Nexon Korea yet are available worldwide with no separate service published under the local consolidated company's portfolio.

Since then, the company has fully released three more mobile games: Hollywood U, High School Story and Choices: Stories You Play. In November 2017, Pixelberry was acquired by Nexon.

""Key People: Jun-Mo Kwon (CEO), Tae-hwan So (co-CEO)

4:33 was created in 2009 by former members of Entelligent Inc, a game developer that was acquired by Nexon Mobile in 2005. Jun-Mo Kwon, one of the co-founders of 4:33 and Entelligent, served as a Chief Executive at Nexon Mobile after Entelligent was acquired ([url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/person/16128953]Kwon’s profile[/url]). Not surprisingly, some of the unofficial sources state that 4:33 has retained its corporate culture from the past. What was surprising is that unlike everyone’s prediction that 4:33 will come up with a game app, its first ever launched product was a productivity app called, ‘Master of Discounts,’ which centralizes the membership discount and coupon management. After a great success with its first product, 4:33 returned to its roots and developed mobile-based games. Some of the big hits include, ‘The Secret of Moreau’s,’ ‘Arrow,’ and ‘EpicHearts.’ Although some of its games were controversial for their lack of originality, 4:33 was successful in raising capital, most recently raising $9 million investments from VCs in 2013.""

The group was formed over the first half of 2014, following Karumaruka ＊ Circle's release in September 2013, by people who loved the game and wanted to see it reach a wider audience. Translation work officially kicked off on June 12th. Despite initially posting progress at a promising pace, a year into the project things started to stall, as the core translator, one of the founding members of the group, decided he was going to personally review every route and every line of text before the patch could be released. By March 2015 all translation work except for this ""final review"" was done; but the long wait had only just begun. By August of the same year, only three routes remained to be reviewed, but they would each end up taking one or even two years of time to complete. During this long wait, the project gradually became a meme in Chinese VN circles, with meme images such as one depicting a patient waking up from a coma in the year 2034, only to find out that the translation was still not done. Luckily, the project was never abandoned, and in August 2019, at long last, work on the game's concluding True Route was wrapped up. After a month of final testing, the patch was released on September 27th, just in time for Karumaruka ＊ Circle's sixth anniversary."

It's already been a month in development. We had four updates. A lot changed. When we started, we didn't really know where we'll get. But now we have a course. We worked a lot on graphics and story. Listened to countless responses. We also had to learn something about code in order to make everything work. I do hope we'll be able to finish the project.

p12091,in,en,Studio Midnight Springs,,"","Midnight Springs is ran solely by one person, Elena. With the sheer scope of this sort of project, there are a lot of others involved: illustrators, voice actors, composers, sound engineers, editors, and more, but Elena is the sole person doing script writing and coding. She is also the only one with a consistently-dedicated work schedule to ApoYume, which is why the estimate for completion is not easy to pin down.

A small business since 2015, Midnight Springs has gone through several art mediums and even a name change, before Elena returned to her first passion: writing. Arthritis and carpal tunnel issues forced her hand in choosing artistic direction, but the passion behind her stories has never waned all this time.

Despite being a bit rusty still, she hopes her writing can bring justice to Apocalyptic Dream (and a couple other planned Visual Novels!) within the decade. ApoYume is only the start to hopefully a library of horror titles under Midnight Springs' name.

Third Born creates an almost unsettling introspection. If players come away with a new perspective on morality, how others view the world, or the costs of leadership, we’ve done our job.

Our first game, Elemental Assassin, lets players experience a magical power fantasy through its VR earth-bending system. The mechanics, inspired by Avatar the Last Airbender, let players manipulate the earth itself. It is a short fast-paced action infiltration game available here for free!

Games are what I love more than any other entertainment, they immerse us in themselves, telling us incredible stories, making us fall in love with their characters, and dragging us deep into the gameplay. Simply put, I'm a gamer to the bone. I just cannot live without them. And naturally, at some point, I came across some adult games. I believe the first ones were flash SWF games. But of course, the industry has not stood still and evolved since then. I have played in many genres and specific games. Romantic, twisted, Japanese, Western, good, bad, and many others. Some games had a good story, others had fascinating erotic scenes. But rarely was there a balance between the two. And I was thinking to myself,can I do something better, can I do something that matches my tastes and quality standards?""

Eroge games, or ""erotic games,"" are video games that often contain explicit sexual content and nudity. These types of games have been around for decades, but they've recently seen a resurgence in popularity. Many gamers see eroge as a niche genre with unique appeal, while others enjoy the risqué nature of the games and the challenge of trying to complete them without getting caught.

What genres do eroge games typically fall into?
Eroge games can generally be classified into two main categories: adventure and simulation. Adventure eroge usually involve players taking on the role of a character who must navigate a complex world and solve puzzles or problems in order to progress."

Brian and Scott have met during their time studying at Carnegie Mellon University, and have founded the studio after selling their Kinect game concept to a high-profile undisclosed company. Through their shared belief in games as a medium for connecting people, the duo began experimenting with numerous prototypes and genres, some of which earned features on the iOS App Store.

By 2015, with a growing team, and a few titles under its belt, the studio decided to return to its roots, and explore the medium further. Setting out with a new mission statement to create “unique, heartfelt experiences that bring people joy”, SIGONO released OPUS: The Day We Found Earth in 2016

p15511,ng,en,Underground Studio,,"","Underground Studio started out being made by me - Jachu! I have worked on a couple of productions before - mostly as a 3D artist but it was never something that I came up with. I was really unsure about starting my own project with my own idea for the game but I guess the time has come! I came out with the Race of Life story but I was struggling to write the dialogues for it, mostly because English is not my first language (and I'm not a writer at all!). With help came Joshua - he poured words on paper and pushed life into my characters!  

Joshua is a writer and a wrench monkey. When he’s not at his keyboard typing away on his latest manuscript, he can be found swearing profusely into the engine bay of one of his project cars. While he has ghost-written for many individuals and industries, Race of Life is his first foray into adult gaming. Some of his greatest achievements include driving a Nissan R32 GTR around the Mount Panorama circuit, bluffing his way into pit lane in Monaco, and coming third in his second-grade spelling bee. 

“I really like the potential of Adult Visual Novels. They allow the player to experience a story in a way that you can’t with a book or movie, but add more structure than you have in a fully sandbox-style game. I think the story we have here is very different to what’s out there, and I hope everyone feels something about the characters and story arcs as they play out.”

Screenwriter studying at Taras Shevchenko University at the Faculty of Ukrainian Philology.
A PR manager who did not do this before, but continues to study as an artist.
And a schoolgirl who will become an artist.

We are absolute newcomers in this field, and here is a brief overview of who we are and what we do:
Susanna Zubchenko (Bisususa) – idea, script, character concept, final part, coding, sounds;
Mariia Smolyar – script, translation, news voice;
Yehor Barbarskyi (BarBADroid) – the basis of the artistic part and background;
Veronika Mashkovska – promotion and media, translation editing;
Moki – art and background concepts;
Slava – sounds and music.[/quote]

My name is Roo. I have been developing and publishing games and movies for three years now. It has been a dream of mine to bring entertainment to the masses for a huge part of my life and I am extremely happy to finally bring joy to many people.

Another very important aspect of what I do besides creating games is preservation of licensed games. Usually we give away digital copies of our games for free and sell the physical copies for a small profit simply to keep them alive for a new generation. I sincerely hope you enjoy what we build and keep retro gaming alive for many years to come.

Thank you for visiting my little Patreon page I setup for my game. Without boring you too much, I'd just like to give you a brief background about myself and why I'm making this game (and more to come. fingers crossed). I've always been someone who's into story telling and coding. I've been a Visual Novel player for a long time now and I decided to take the leap from ""Can I do this?"" to ""I'm gonna do this"". Being a solo developer I put in a lot of my time into this project (~5 days a week) because I really enjoy the entire process and it has never felt like a chore to me.




The Sword Bearer is my first project and I plan on finishing this one 100% before I even consider the next one. I'm a massive fan of Medieval Fantasy themed games and movies and so I decided to write something that I'm passionate about rather than what gets the most number of clicks. The choices you make WILL change your path to the end and even the way your story ends. There will be some side quests that won't really impact your ending *as much* but will have little interesting stories that involve non main characters much like side quests in a Rpg. You can ignore these side quests and that won't make your ending better/worse because they're designed to add flavor to your gameplay. So if you're someone who likes a little break from the main story, this is for you.

Despite each company having different representative directors, Satou had full control over the member companies and had overall supervision of their games.

In 2000, Panther Software Inc. changed its name to Interlex Inc. but continued to use the Panther Software name. Some time around 2004, a new company named Panther Software Inc. was established as a subsidiary of Interlex. In 2005, Interlex left the Yuuto Group, with CD Bros. taking over control of it, and Panther Software Inc. was spun off as an independent company, which later became part of [url=/p1899]Contents Traffic Co., Ltd.[/url].

In May 2009, the same time CD Bros., D.O., and ZyX became part of Contents Traffic Co., Ltd., Interlex changed its name to Interlex Core and its subsidiary Interlex Sales changed its name to Interlex."

It was founded with the aim of further spreading uncensored Japanese content to the world, allowing fans to enjoy these original products in all their unpixellated glory.

HentaiAid cooperates with creators on the basis of a one-to-one contract. All works sold are genuine. Aside from the site operating costs and translation fees, the money from your purchase directly goes into the creators' pockets!

Our company does run its own storefront on the web, but our main business remains translating games and doujinshi. As such, publications of our work occasionally appear on third-party platforms as well.

M.L.S.I","Monolith Software Inc., best known as Monolith Soft and sometimes shortened to M.L.S.I., is a Japanese game developer founded on October 1st, 1999 by a group of former Squaresoft employees leaded by Tetsuya Takahashi, Hirohide Sugiura and Yasuyuki Honne, with the financial support of Namco.

As a subsidiary of Namco Limited (later Namco Bandai Games and currently Bandai Namco Games), they developed games for multiple systems, mainly for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. Their debut game was Xenosaga Episode I, part of the Xenosaga series, a spiritual successor to Xenogears, which many staff members worked on while employed at Square. Other games developed under Namco ownership includes Baten Kaitos and Namco x Capcom.

In April 2007, Nintendo agreed with Monolith Soft to purchase a 80% of ownership on the company, while Bandai Namco would retain 16% until 2012, when they completely divested. Since then, Monolith Soft has created the Xenoblade Chronicles series, itself a spiritual successor to Xenosaga. Other games include Soma Bringer, Disaster: Day of Crisis and Project X Zone, which is a spiritual sequel to Namco x Capcom, as well supporting on the development of Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

In 2011, Monolith Soft opened a Kyoto studio near to the Nintendo's headquarters, to provide assistance on game development. So far, this division helped on the development of various games from The Legend of Zelda series (Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds, and Breath of the Wild) and Animal Crossing entries (New Leaf, Happy Home Designer, and New Horizons), and also collaborated with the Splatoon series and Pikmin 3.
